  "bio": "Good morning! I'm Rare Dali Munchkin. I enjoy eating until I loathe myself, grooming, and spinning sick beats. Sometimes I daydream of a life full of reciting poetry, hamburgers, and volunteering at the local kitten rescue shelter. We can be friends, but keep the ultra purrsonal stuff to yourself, please.",
