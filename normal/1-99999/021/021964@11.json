  "bio": "Hey cutie! I'm OTAKU, RECESSIVE TIGER, GEN 11. I enjoy riding dirty, fighting the patriarchy, and reading garfield. Sometimes I daydream of a life full of eating until I loathe myself, apple pie, and volunteering at the local kitten rescue shelter. In time you'll learn how purrfect I am.",
